# TeamTeach

## Description

This project is developed using React.js, JSX, and a variety of additional libraries such as Express, Node.js, Sequelize, as well as cors, multer, cookieparser, and path.

This website is a platform where users can publish posts related to education and lessons. Posts may include materials related to lesson plans, presentations, and other useful information. Users can view posts from other users and leave comments.

Additionally, there is a "Resources" section where users can share files for assignments or other useful materials.

There is also a "Tools" section where users can find various tools and resources for work, such as Canva, PowerPoint, Maya, and others.
